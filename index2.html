		  <h1>Quote 1:</h1>
		  <p>
			 I evoke the term <strong>'handmade web'</strong> to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
			software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
			corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
			which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
			identity.

		 </p>
		 <p>
			I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web
			pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists 
			books.
